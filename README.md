**4. Key Analysis Steps**

In this project, I performed several key data analysis steps:

  **- Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Using Pandas for cleaning the data drop null value, add new column like day name, then using SQL for analysis and calculated key metrics.
    
   **- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Calculating important metrics such as total revenue, average operational value, total sold, gross merchant value, and average order value.
    
   **- Sales Trend Analysis**: Analyzing sales patterns based on time (daily, monthly, and yearly) to identify peak sales periods.
    
   **- Product Performance**: Identifying the top 5 best-selling items and the most profitly product category.

**5. Key Insights**

Here are a few of the key insights presented in the interactive dashboard:

   **- Busiest Days**: The highest sales occur during the weekend, particulary saturday and sunday.
   
   **- Most Popular Product**: 'Water Bottle - 30 oz' is the best-selling products sold in the store.
   
   **- Increase Profit**: Profits increased significally in 2013 and 2015, this occurred because sales began to add accessories and clothing category. This was evident in 2014, when sales in these sectors were discontinued, and profits also declined.
   
   **- Peak Months**: The Highest Sales occur during the June and December, where this is a holiday month.
